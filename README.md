# Superhero_Hunter

This project is a Superhero hunter using HTML,CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. In this project, I have used Marvel API to fetch the content and display it on my website.I have created a Marvel Developer account and I have fetched the details using the authorization keys.The main features of this website are,
    * Home page with a navigation bar and search bar.Based on the input in the search bar first five relevant results are displayed.
    * Superhero Page - If you click on any of the results displayed in the home page it will take you to this page.This page has the complete description about the character.
    * Favourites Page - You can add the characters to favourites list or you can remove them from the favourites list. 


## Function

You can input any marvel character in the search box. Based on the input, first five relevant results are displayed. Each result has a thumbnail picture of the character along with name and favourites button. The favourites button will be "Add to Favourites" or "Remove from Favourites" based on whether it is present in the favourites list or not.If you click on the name of any character it will take you to the "Superhero Page". This page will display the entire description of the character. You will  have the  "Add to Favourites" or "Remove from Favourites" button here as well. Then is the "Favourites" Page where a list of all favourite characters will be displayed. You can learn more about them by clickong on "More Info" button. You can remove these characters from the favourites list. All changes made will be instantly reflected. I have attached the screenshot for your reference.
